# 13021326

""" Implement a function
day_of_year(d, m)
that takes as parameters the number d in the range 1..31 representing a day, and
the number m in the range 1..12 representing a month of the year 2020. It returns
how many complete days passed from the beginning of the fist day of 2020 until the
specified date d/m/2020. Note that 2020 is a leap year, so February has 29 days. The
function must return -1 if the specified date d/m/2020 is not a valid date. Importing
any libraries is NOT allowed.
Indicative test cases:
assert day_of_year(3,1)==2 #must be True
assert day_of_year(10,5)==130 #must be True
assert day_of_year(31,6)==-1 #must be True"""
